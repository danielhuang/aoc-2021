My solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021), written in Rust. The code requires Rust nightly to run.

Inputs are saved in `src/bin`, with files designed for sample and actual inputs. `1.input.txt` would be the actual input, and `1.sample.txt` would be the sample input. Running the code in debug will load the sample input, while in release mode, the actual input will be used.

Just a warning: this code is very messy. Please don't take it too seriously ðŸ™‚.
